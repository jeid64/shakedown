#TODO, fix programatically

# MLB is being deployed with "*" role but it really should be deployed with "slave_public".
# Note, MLB by default from Universe is deployed with slave_public, this person just changed it to "*".

# Why?
#Probably because they may have wanted to move it to their private agents because they have a limited number of public agents.

# Cleanup:
# Destroy MLB after you're done.
